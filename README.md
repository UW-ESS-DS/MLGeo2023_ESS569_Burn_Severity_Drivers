### Why I chose the MIT Licence 
The MIT License is a clear and accommodating open-source license, permitting free use, alteration, and sharing of software, and it 
requires giving credit to the original creator; this has led to its broad acceptance and has removed obstacles for its adoption.

## Favorite Earth Science topics
* Forest and fire ecology
* Climate change
* Conservation and Biodiversity
 
## My Project 
### Background 
Forest fires are a growing concern, with their frequency and severity increasing in recent decades. 
The Bootleg fire in Oregon, which burned over 400,000 acres of forestland, provides an opportunity 
to explore the role of fuel treatments in mitigating fire severity and evaluate the importance of 
environmental variables as drivers of burn severity. The major categories of variables that will be 
explored include: bioclimate, climate, fire weather, topography, forest management, and forest structure. 
While all categories have some importance in explaining burn-severity variability, only forest management 
and forest structure are under our control. Thus, understanding which variables within these two categories 
are the most important will serve as a valuable resource for land managers seeking to establish fire 
regimes that promote forest resilience through strategic fuel load reduction.

### Research question
What are the primary factors influencing fire severity, and to what extent can forest structure and fuel 
treatment variables account for the variation in fire severity? 
How do these factors operate at both a global and local scale?

### Datasets 
Fuel-treatments, environmental variables, satellite-derived burn severity indices, LiDAR forest metrics. 
The original data format was eaither raster or shapefile. All varibales were extracted and compiled in a 
single .csv file. 

### Methods 
TBD. Techiques could include random forests, Shapley Additive Explanations, geospatial analysis, and more.
